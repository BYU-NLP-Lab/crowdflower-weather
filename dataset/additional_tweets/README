If you wish to augment your dataset with still more tweets, do

1) build the dataset as usual in ..
2) run collect_tweets.sh for as long as you want and then stop it with ctrl-c
    * Note that this script requires that you give it programmatic access to twitter. 
    Do this by creating a twitter account, then an application 
    (https://dev.twitter.com/oauth/overview/application-owner-access-tokens).
    Finally create a cred.json file containing your twitter application keys and secrets
    e.g., 
      {
        "consumer_key":"KEY",
        "consumer_secret":"SECRET",
        "access_token_key":"KEY",
        "access_token_secret":"SECRET"
       }

3) run add_tweets_to_dataset.sh
