Paul felt notes:

* weather tweets were sentiment-labeled and used as a part of the crowscale 2013 shared task.
these files were obtained from crowdflower's data-for-everyone initiative. 
http://www.crowdflower.com/data-for-everyone

* The "evaluated" task performs a meta-annotation judging whether each aggregated judgment 
from task 1 is correct or not. We use the aggregated version of this to assemble a 
gold standard.

* bo han's twitter normalization dictionary originally came from the twitterparaphrase.
